# Hide Weapons In Animations

This mod makes it so during some animations equipped weapons become invisible, then become visible again after the animation has played.

These animations are non-combat things like typing on a computer and pointing. Without this mod those animations will play with whatever weapons you have equipped, which looks really dumb.

The best example of this is Atton typing on the Ebon Hawk. With the mod he'll type with whatever weapon you have equipped. With this mod, the weapon will be invisible while he is typing.
